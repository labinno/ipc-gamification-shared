HabitRPG's translations are managed on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/habitrpg/).

The files in this folder are automatically pulled from Transifex, with
exception of the original American-English strings which are managed
directly through GitHub in `locales/en`.

Do not edit files in any locales directory except for `locales/en`!

Before starting to translate, please read [Guidance for Linguists](http://habitrpg.wikia.com/wiki/Guidance_for_Linguists)
and note especially its information about the [Translations Trello card](https://trello.com/c/SvTsLdRF/12-translations).
